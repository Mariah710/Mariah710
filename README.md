## About Me

- I'm currently learning how to train chicks and rats. We've spent weeks observing their behavior. We are now training them do to tricks. We've taught the chicks how to pick a white dot, then to peck a red dot to be reinforced with food. We're currently training our rats to run through a maze, press a lever repeatedly in a skinner box, and perform a behavior that involves three steps that involves an aspect of discrimination.
